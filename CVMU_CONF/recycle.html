The breakthrough achievements in any field requires a collaborative and integrated synergy among all the disciplines of science. The seemingly different disciplines of science have very thin lines of demarcation among them and they largely reconcile and strengthen the knowledge base of one another. Researchers have started realizing the benefits of working together across traditional disciplinary lines. Interdisciplinary collaborations have fostered creativity, innovation, and promote out-of-the-box thinking. They have resulted into combining diverse perspectives, methodologies, and approaches, enabling scientists to tackle complex problems with greater effectiveness. Such synergy among the different fields like Chemical Sciences, Physical Sciences, Biological and Environmental Sciences as well as Mathematical Sciences have advantages like Enhanced problem-solving skills and strategies, provide opportunities for breakthrough discoveries through the integration of diverse interests and expertise and the augmentation of the pace of scientific progress leading to  the accomplishment of sustainable development.</td>

Humanities have a niche approach in incorporating collaborative and interdisciplinary learning among the students. In the current global context, various streams of Humanities like Journalism, Economics, Psychology, English, Political Sciences, Social Work, history and fine arts etc., have become crucial to inculcate the ability among the students and the academia to analyse and synthesize the accumulated knowledge required for the betterment of the society. The research and dialogue in humanities can form the logical and rational arguments in a most creative approach while addressing the needs of the society and strengthen the global synergy. </td>

                <td rowspan="7">Management as an Academic and Professional Discipline continues to take a competitive edge despite of the vast improvements in information technology. Business managers often need to make decisions that affect the business' fortunes one way or other. While it might be possible to use complex mathematical formulas by hand to compute the best solution, computers transform the whole process into a routine task of feeding certain information as input and obtaining suggestions for best solutions as output. It is the synergy between efficient, accurate and speedy equipment and humans with common sense, intelligence and judgment that really gives power to MIS.
